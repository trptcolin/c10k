# C10K experimentation

This is a learning project for me, to get my head wrapped around
high-performance servers at a lower level than I'm used to. In particular, the
things I'm looking to take away from this project are:

- Excellent knowledge of the sockets API
- Good knowledge of costs & benefits of asynchronous I/O / events
- Good facility with Linux tools including strace & tcpdump
- Good working knowledge of C, and modern C programming practices/tools

Don't even think about using this code in production.
